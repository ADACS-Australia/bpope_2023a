The starry Python API
=====================

This page describes the two main ways of interfacing with the ``starry`` code.

The :doc:`Map <MapFactory>` class factory allows users to quickly instantiate
surface maps described by spherical harmonics.

        :maxdepth: 2

        MapFactory

The :doc:`Keplerian <Kepler>` module allows users to model systems of
objects, each with their own surface map.

    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2
