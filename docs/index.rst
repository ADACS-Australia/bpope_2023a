Welcome to the :py:mod:`starry` documentation. The :py:mod:`starry` code package
enables the computation of light curves for various applications in
astronomy: transits and secondary eclipses of exoplanets, light curves of
eclipsing binaries, rotational phase curves of exoplanets, light curves of
planet-planet and planet-moon occultations, and more. By modeling celestial
body surface maps as sums of spherical harmonics, :py:mod:`starry` does all
this **analytically** and is therefore fast, stable, and differentiable.

Check out the links below for examples, tutorials, detailed documentation of the
API, and more.
