    "A major part of the philosophy of `starry` is a certain amount of agnosticism about what the surface of a star or planet actually looks like. Many codes fit stellar light curves by solving for the number, location, size, and contrast of star spots. This is usually fine if you *know* the stellar surface consists of a certain number of discrete star spots of a given shape. In general, however, that's a very strong prior to assume. And even in cases where it holds, the problem is still extremely degenerate and lies in a space that is quite difficult to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, in `starry` we assume the surface is described by a vector of spherical harmonic coefficients. The advantage of this is that (1) it automatically bakes in a Gaussian-process smoothness prior over the surface map, in which the scale of features is dictated by the degree of the expansion; and (2) under gaussian priors and gaussian errors, the posterior over surface maps is *analytic*. If and only if the data and prior support the existence of discrete star spots on the surface, the posterior will reflect that.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes it's convenient to restrict ourselves to the case of discrete star spots. In `starry`, we therefore implement the `spot` method, which adds a spot-like feature to the surface by expanding a circular top-hat in terms of spherical harmonics."
