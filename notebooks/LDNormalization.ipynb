    "What's going on? The image is actually fine most of the time, but at two distinct phases, the specific intensity across the map becomes very, very large. The reason for this is that in the first release of `starry` (`v0.2.2`), the limb darkening normalization was unphysical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional limb darkening laws tell you how the specific intensity scales with the projected radius on the disk, but only up to an unknown normalization constant. In other words, the laws all tell you what $\\frac{I(x, y)}{I_0}$ is, but what we really want to know is $I(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `starry 0.2.2`, we made the (somewhat reasonable) assumption that limb darkening should not affect the total disk-integrated flux. In other words, limb darkening should only **re-arrange** the intensity on the surface of the visible disk, making the edges darker and the center brighter. But if you integrate over the entire disk you should get the same number -- the total flux coming from the object -- no matter what limb darkening coefficients you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that makes perfect sense for stars with uniform photospheric emission, since it follows from the idea that the star should appear the same from all vantage points. If I were to turn on limb darkening and the flux I measure (say) decreased, it would have to decrease for **all** observers throughout the universe. But that would mean the total luminosity of the star decreased, which is unphysical. (If limb darkening actually did decrease the total luminosity of a star, the star wouldn't be in thermodynamic equilibrium. And since it would be producing more energy than it was radiating, it would have to heat up, until its luminosity returned to the original value.) We therefore assumed that the normalization constant was such that the total flux seen by an observer had to remain unchanged.\n",

    "\n",
    "But it's tricky to think about computing the total luminosity of an arbitrary limb-darkened object. A brain-dead way to do this is to measure the disk-integrated flux coming from that object from every possible vantage point: that is proportional (or equal to, in the right units) the object's luminosity. If you put an observer everywhere on the surface of a large sphere centered on the object, and ask every observer to count all the photons they see, add those up and you now know how many photons the object emitted in total.\n",

I puzzled over this for a while, since the limb darkening procedure is not a linear operation (at least I haven't figured out how to make it linear yet). That makes it very hard to compute this integral analytically. But after thinking about this for a while, I convinced myself that the normalization **cannot depend on what the map looks like.** In other words, whether my map is the spherical harmonic expansion of the Earth or a simple uniform map, the normalization constant will be the same, and depend **only** on the limb-darkening coefficients.\n",

    "This is related to the fact that the only spherical harmonic that integrates to something nonzero over $4\\pi$ steradians is the $Y_{0,0}$ harmonic. All others contribute net zero luminosity.
