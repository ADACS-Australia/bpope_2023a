    "The default behavior for reflected light maps in `starry` is Lambertian scattering, meaning the body reflects light isotropically. This is an idealized case, and real planetary and lunar surfaces don't usually behave this way. Instead, there is typically a phase dependence to the scattered light. Planets with atmospheres, for instance, preferentially scatter light along the forward and backward direction due to Rayleigh scattering, while rocky bodies with rough surfaces may exhibit a more complex phase dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're still working on implementing different scattering laws, but a fairly straightforward model for rough surfaces is that of [Oren and Nayar (1994)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/192161.192213). We implement a simple version of this model in `starry`, in which the surface roughness is described by a single parameter, $\\sigma$. The Oren and Nayar model assumes the surface is composed of many tiny facets oriented at random angles, and $\\sigma$ is equal to the standard deviation of the distribution of their orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `starry`, the $\\sigma$ parameter can be changed by setting the `roughness` attribute of a map in units of `map.angle_unit` (degrees, by default). Let's look at a map with zero surface roughness, i.e., the Lambertian case, over the full range of illumination phases:"

    "The most obvious difference is at full phase, where the body appears to be super-Lambertian: more light is scattered back to the observer than you'd get in the isotropic case. This is mainly due to the behavior at the limb. For a Lambertian surface, the surface normal for points along the limb is nearly parallel to the light rays, so those regions jut don't get illuminated much. But if the surface is very rough, there will be lots of facets near the limb that are oriented more perpendicular to the incident light, therefore reflecting much more light back to the observer at full phase. There are differences at other phases, too, which we can see more clearly by looking at the phase curve of the two bodies:"
